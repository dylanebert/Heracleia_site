<h4>iWork - An Interactive Robot-based Memory Assessment System</h4>
<p>Lego construction task paradigms are utilized in order to develop logico-mathematical abilities through visuospatial memory. 
This study aims to assess the relationship between Lego construction ability, cognitive abilities, speed and accuracy performance 
in workers in the industries by employing humanoid robots to assess the stated metrics. This system proposes the development of a 
smart vocational assessment and intervention service system that assesses a worker's needs for training and rehabilitation in an 
experimental setup that simulates a factory. The proposed approach collects and analyzes multisensing human-robot interaction data 
and recommends personalized interventions that can improve the individuals for a particular job. In our implementation, Aldebaran's 
NAO robot gradually learns the features and thresholds needed to construct a decision tree that matches the expected Lego model with 
the user's Lego assembly. The results from 615 test samples show that the NAO robot was able to correctly identify the Lego blocks 
configuration assembled by the user with an accuracy 81% of the time. Finally, we discuss limitations of the proposed solution and 
we suggest future contributions that can overpass these limitations and boost the accuracy of our proposed solution.</p>
