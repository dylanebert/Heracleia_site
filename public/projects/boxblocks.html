<h4>Box and Blocks</h4>
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming a tool that is more often used in various types of activities, 
including rehabilitation. However, studies using VR rehabilitation mainly focus on comparing the performances of participants, 
but not their opinions. In this paper, we present a virtual version of the Box and Blocks Test. We also present the results of a 
pilot study where participants completed a physical version of the Box and Blocks Test and the virtual version, comparing their 
scores and opinions. We also compare how the participants viewed the passage of time while performing both versions as a way to 
see how engaged they were during the task.</p>
