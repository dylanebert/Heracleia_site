<h4>VARM - Using Virtual Reality to Program Robotic Arms</h4>
This paper describes a novel teleoperation interface system to program industrial robotic arms. The system demonstrates the 
potential to create an interactive programmable interface that enables users with no prior knowledge of robotics to safely 
program mechanical manipulators with the use of Virtual Reality and the Leap Motion Controller. The system takes full advantage 
of the Leap Motion to navigate the virtual workspace of the robot that was created through the kinematic properties of the 
real robot. The implementation of the application was deemed possible by interfacing the Unity Engine with the Barrett WAM. 
Preliminary experimental results show the ability of the system to engage and train appropriately the user in robot programming.
