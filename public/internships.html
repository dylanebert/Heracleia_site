<h2>REU Program</h2>
<p>We participate in the NSF-funded <b>Research Experience for Undegraduates (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517" target="_blank">REU</a>)</b>, which provides
research experience and generous funding for excellent and inquisitive undergraduate students.</p>
<h3>Expectations</h3>
<p>REUs will be expected to conduct research alongside graduate students and faculty - that is, to build systems, conduct experiments, write and publish papers.
They will either contribute to existing projects, propose their own project, or be assigned tasks. Progress will be reported at lab meetings.
Students will be expected to have some degree of autonomy - to conduct research and make progress without incessant guidance or supervision.</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>REUs are funded by the NSF REU grant for an amount of $15/hour, up to a maximum of 39 hours per week. Hours will depend on availability, and students are
expected to log their own hours and provide documentation or demos to demonstrate their progress.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>US Citizenship</li>
	<li>Undergraduate student at UTA</li>
